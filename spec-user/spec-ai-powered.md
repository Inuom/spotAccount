# üí∏ Shared Subscription Debt Manager

## üéØ Project Summary / Objective
You manage a shared subscription with several friends (e.g., 5 people).  
You pay every month, and your friends reimburse you either:
1. by automatic transfer,  
2. or manually when you request payment.

The goal is to automate:
- the calculation of each friend‚Äôs share,
- the management of payments (creation, tracking, verification),
- and the visualization of current and future debts.

## üìú Speckit Constitution

- Purpose: establish shared rules for scope, decisions, quality, and delivery.
- Scope: this spec covers MVP for shared subscription debt management.
- Non-Goals: external banking integrations; complex payment automation beyond manual/verified flows.
- Decision Principles: simplicity first, security by default, testability, infra-as-code, least privilege.
- Roles: product owner validates scope; tech lead owns architecture; contributors follow this constitution.
- Change Management: open PR with spec delta; record rationale; require 1 approval (PO or tech lead).
- Definition of Done: spec updated; code implemented; tests added/green; docs updated; CI passing.
- Quality Gates: lint/type-check; unit ‚â• 80% coverage; integration paths for auth, charges, payments.
- Security & Privacy: hashed passwords; RBAC; HTTPS; rate limiting; audit logs for critical actions.
- Testing Policy: unit (services, utils), integration (API + DB), E2E (critical flows) on CI.
- Documentation & Traceability: changelog in PR; link tasks/issues; API docs updated.
- Communication Cadence: async via PRs; weekly sync review; immediate escalation for blockers/security.
- Approval: product owner signs off on scope; tech lead signs off on architecture & security.

## üîå REST Endpoints (MVP)

### Auth
- `POST /auth/login`
- `POST /auth/refresh`

### Users
- `GET /users`
- `POST /users`
- `PATCH /users/:id`
- `DELETE /users/:id`

### Subscriptions
- `POST /subscriptions`
- `GET /subscriptions`
- `PATCH /subscriptions/:id`

### Charges
- `POST /subscriptions/:id/generate-charges?until=YYYY-MM-DD`
- `GET /charges?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
- `GET /charges/:id/shares`

### Payments
- `POST /payments`

- `PATCH /payments/:id`
- `DELETE /payments/:id`

### Reports
- `GET /reports/summary?date=YYYY-MM-DD`

## üß† Business Logic

### Calculate User Balance
```text
balance(userId, date):
  total_due = sum of charges <= date
  total_paid = verified payments (and pending if configured)
  return total_due - total_paid
```
### üß† Main Rules

- Equal share by default  
- Optionally include pending payments in balance forecast  
- Charges automatically generated every month (cron job or manual trigger)
