# Tasks: CICD and AWS Hosting with Terraform

**Feature**: 002-cicd-aws-terraform  
**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

This feature implements automated CI/CD pipeline with AWS infrastructure provisioning using Terraform for a simple, cost-effective deployment solution.

**PRIORITY SIMPLIFICATION**: Based on user clarifications, the infrastructure should be simplified to:
- Simple ECS with public IP (no ALB) for direct access
- Public RDS access for maximum simplicity  
- Basic security groups with HTTPS only
- Minimal monitoring with application-level logging
- Stop-and-start deployments with brief downtime acceptable

**MVP Scope**: Complete infrastructure simplification + CI/CD pipeline completion

## Suggested MVP Scope

**Recommended MVP**: Complete remaining infrastructure simplification + CI/CD pipeline
- **Immediate Priority**: Infrastructure simplification (remove ALB, use public subnets)
- **Next Priority**: Complete CI/CD pipeline implementation
- **Then**: Production deployment and testing

**Current Focus Areas**:
1. **🚨 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Infrastructure Simplification** (4 tasks):
   - Update ECS to use public subnets (currently private)
   - Update RDS to public access (currently private)
   - Remove ALB configuration (simplify to direct ECS access)
   - Update security groups for public access

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Completion** (12 tasks):
   - Complete GitHub Actions workflow
   - Add deployment automation
   - Add testing integration

3. **Production Readiness** (8 tasks):
   - Production configuration
   - Health checks
   - Monitoring setup

**CONTEXT FOR NEW CHAT**: The infrastructure is mostly complete but needs simplification per user clarifications. Focus on the 4 infrastructure simplification tasks first.

**Advanced Features**: Phases 5-7 (User Stories 3-4 + Polish)
- Advanced infrastructure automation
- Enhanced production deployment
- Cross-cutting concerns and polish
