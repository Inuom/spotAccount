# Research: CICD and AWS Hosting with Terraform

**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Feature**: 002-cicd-aws-terraform  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish best practices for simple AWS infrastructure with CI/CD

## Research Tasks

### 1. Simple ECS with Public IP Configuration

**Task**: Research ECS Fargate with public IP configuration for direct access without load balancer

**Decision**: Use ECS Fargate with public subnets and assign_public_ip = true

**Rationale**: 
- Eliminates ALB complexity and costs (~$16/month savings)
- Provides direct access via public IP
- Suitable for low-traffic applications
- Maintains simplicity as requested

**Alternatives considered**:
- Application Load Balancer: Rejected due to complexity and cost
- NAT Gateway with private subnets: Rejected due to cost (~$45/month) and complexity
- Service Discovery: Rejected as overkill for simple setup

### 2. Public RDS Access Security

**Task**: Research secure public RDS access patterns for simple infrastructure

**Decision**: RDS with public access using security groups and SSL enforcement

**Rationale**:
- Security groups restrict access to specific IPs/security groups
- SSL/TLS encryption in transit
- Simpler than VPC endpoints or private subnets
- Cost-effective for simple setups

**Alternatives considered**:
- Private subnets with NAT Gateway: Rejected due to cost and complexity
- VPC endpoints: Rejected as overkill for simple setup
- RDS Proxy: Rejected due to additional complexity

### 3. Basic Security Group Configuration

**Task**: Research minimal security group configuration for public ECS and RDS

**Decision**: 
- ECS Security Group: Allow HTTPS (443) from anywhere, HTTP (80) from anywhere
- RDS Security Group: Allow PostgreSQL (5432) from ECS security group only
- Remove ALB security group (not needed)

**Rationale**:
- HTTPS enforcement for security
- Minimal attack surface
- Cost-effective approach
- Meets basic security requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- WAF and advanced security: Rejected due to complexity and cost
- Private subnets only: Rejected due to complexity
- Open access: Rejected for security reasons

### 4. Minimal Monitoring Strategy

**Task**: Research minimal monitoring approach for simple infrastructure

**Decision**: Application-level logging only with CloudWatch basic monitoring

**Rationale**:
- CloudWatch logs for application debugging
- Basic ECS service health monitoring
- No complex alerting or metrics
- Cost-effective approach

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full observability stack: Rejected due to complexity and cost
- No monitoring: Rejected for basic debugging needs
- Third-party monitoring: Rejected for simplicity

### 5. Simple Deployment Strategy

**Task**: Research simple deployment patterns without zero-downtime requirements

**Decision**: Stop-and-start deployment with brief downtime acceptable

**Rationale**:
- ECS service update with new task definition
- Brief downtime during container replacement
- Simple and reliable approach
- No complex blue-green or rolling update logic

**Alternatives considered**:
- Blue-green deployments: Rejected due to complexity
- Rolling updates: Rejected due to complexity
- Canary deployments: Rejected due to complexity

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**Task**: Research GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for Terraform and application deployment

**Decision**: Single pipeline with stages: test → build → terraform plan → terraform apply → deploy

**Rationale**:
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD (already integrated)
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Docker for containerization
- Simple linear pipeline

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate infrastructure and application pipelines: Rejected for simplicity
- Complex multi-environment pipelines: Rejected as only production needed
- Third-party CI/CD: Rejected to keep costs low

### 7. Terraform State Management

**Task**: Research Terraform state management for simple infrastructure

**Decision**: S3 backend with DynamoDB locking for state management

**Rationale**:
- S3 for state storage (already configured)
- DynamoDB for state locking
- Remote state for team collaboration
- Cost-effective approach

**Alternatives considered**:
- Local state: Rejected for team collaboration
- Terraform Cloud: Rejected due to cost
- Complex state management: Rejected for simplicity

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Component | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **ECS Access** | Public IP, no ALB | Simplicity and cost reduction |
| **RDS Access** | Public with security groups | Simplicity with basic security |
| **Security** | Basic security groups | HTTPS enforcement, minimal complexity |
| **Monitoring** | Application logs only | Basic debugging, cost-effective |
| **Deployments** | Stop-and-start | Simple, reliable, brief downtime OK |
| **CI/CD** | Single GitHub Actions pipeline | Integrated, cost-effective |
| **State** | S3 + DynamoDB | Team collaboration, cost-effective |

## Implementation Readiness

All technical unknowns have been resolved. The approach prioritizes simplicity and cost-effectiveness while maintaining basic security and functionality requirements.
