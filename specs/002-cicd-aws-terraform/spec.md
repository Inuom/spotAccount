**Feature Branch**: `002-cicd-aws-terraform`  
**Created**: 2025-01-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "despite the spec definition 001. CICD and hosting on AWS using terraform have been forgoten. It's what we are going to do next."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-22

- Q: How should multi-environment deployments be handled in the CI/CD pipeline? → A: Single pipeline with production environment only expected
- Q: How should infrastructure deployment failures be handled? → A: Automatic rollback to previous working state
- Q: How should CI/CD pipeline timeouts be handled? → A: Fail immediately and alert for manual intervention
- Q: How should sensitive configuration values and API keys be managed? → A: Store secrets as encrypted environment variables in CI/CD (easier approach)
- Q: How should simultaneous deployments to the same environment be handled? → A: Block concurrent deployments to same environment
- Q: How should the backend service be exposed for access? → A: Simple ECS with public IP directly (no ALB)
- Q: How should security be configured for public ECS access? → A: Basic security groups with HTTPS only and standard AWS security practices
- Q: How should the RDS database be configured for access? → A: RDS with public access for maximum simplicity
- Q: What level of monitoring and observability is needed? → A: Minimal logging with application-level monitoring only
- Q: How should application updates be handled? → A: No zero-downtime requirements to keep infrastructure simple

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Code Changes (Priority: P1)

A developer pushes code changes to the repository, and the system automatically runs tests, builds the application, and deploys it to production AWS infrastructure without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Essential for maintaining code quality and enabling rapid iteration during development.

**Independent Test**: Push code changes to main branch; verify all tests pass, application builds successfully, and deploys to production environment automatically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer pushes code to the main branch, **When** the CI/CD pipeline triggers, **Then** all unit tests, integration tests, and security scans run automatically and pass.
2. **Given** all tests pass successfully, **When** the build stage completes, **Then** the application artifacts are created and ready for deployment.
3. **Given** build artifacts are ready, **When** the deployment stage runs, **Then** the application is automatically deployed to AWS infrastructure with zero downtime.

---

### User Story 2 - Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform (Priority: P1)

A system administrator provisions the complete AWS infrastructure for the application using Terraform, including compute, storage, and networking resources.

**Why this priority**: Required foundation for hosting the application - without proper infrastructure, the application cannot be deployed or scaled.

**Independent Test**: Run terraform commands to provision AWS infrastructure; verify all required resources (Fargate, RDS, S3, CloudFront) are created and configured correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Terraform configuration files exist, **When** running `terraform plan`, **Then** it shows the AWS resources that will be created without errors.
2. **Given** a valid terraform plan, **When** running `terraform apply`, **Then** all AWS infrastructure is provisioned successfully and accessible.
3. **Given** infrastructure is provisioned, **When** checking AWS console, **Then** all required services (ECS cluster, RDS database, S3 buckets, CloudFront distribution) are visible and properly configured.

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Infrastructure Updates via CI/CD (Priority: P2)

A developer updates Terraform configuration and the CI/CD pipeline automatically applies infrastructure changes to AWS, ensuring consistency between code and infrastructure.

**Why this priority**: Enables infrastructure as code practices and prevents configuration drift between environments.

**Independent Test**: Modify Terraform configuration; push changes through CI/CD; verify infrastructure updates are applied automatically and consistently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Terraform configuration is updated, **When** changes are pushed to main branch, **Then** the CI/CD pipeline automatically runs `terraform plan` to review proposed changes.
2. **Given** terraform plan shows valid changes, **When** the deployment pipeline runs, **Then** infrastructure updates are applied automatically with proper approval gates.
3. **Given** infrastructure updates complete, **When** checking the AWS environment, **Then** all changes are reflected and the application continues to function normally.

---

### User Story 4 - Production Deployment Pipeline (Priority: P2)

A developer can deploy the application to production AWS environment using the CI/CD pipeline with production-specific configurations.

**Why this priority**: Provides direct deployment capability to the single production environment.

**Independent Test**: Deploy to production environment using the pipeline with production-specific configuration; verify deployment succeeds with zero downtime.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code changes are ready for production, **When** deploying to production environment, **Then** the application deploys successfully with production-specific configuration.
2. **Given** production deployment completes, **When** checking the application, **Then** it functions normally with appropriate performance and security settings.

### Edge Cases

- **Infrastructure deployment failure**: System automatically rolls back to previous working state when partial infrastructure provisioning failures occur.
- **CI/CD pipeline timeout**: System fails immediately when builds or deployments exceed timeout limits and alerts operators for manual intervention.
- **Environment conflicts**: System blocks concurrent deployments to the same environment, preventing conflicts and ensuring deployments run to completion.
- **Resource limits**: What happens when AWS resource limits are reached during provisioning?
- **Secret management**: Sensitive configuration values and API keys are managed using encrypted environment variables in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
