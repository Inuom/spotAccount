# Tasks: CICD and AWS Hosting with Terraform

**Feature**: 002-cicd-aws-terraform  
**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Total Tasks**: 65  
**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Automated CI/CD Pipeline) - 15 tasks

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP First**: Start with User Story 1 (Automated CI/CD Pipeline) to establish the foundation for automated testing, building, and deployment. This provides immediate value and enables rapid iteration.

**Incremental Delivery**: Each user story builds upon the previous one, with User Story 2 (Infrastructure Provisioning) providing the AWS foundation, and User Stories 3-4 adding advanced deployment capabilities.

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order**:
1. **User Story 1** (P1) - Automated CI/CD Pipeline: Foundation for all other stories
2. **User Story 2** (P1) - Infrastructure Provisioning: Prerequisite for deployment
3. **User Story 3** (P2) - Automated Infrastructure Updates: Builds on Stories 1 & 2
4. **User Story 4** (P2) - Production Deployment Pipeline: Builds on Stories 1 & 2

**Parallel Opportunities**: Within each story, many tasks can be executed in parallel (marked with [P]) as they work on different files and have no dependencies on incomplete tasks.
