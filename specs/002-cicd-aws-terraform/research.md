# Research: CICD and AWS Hosting with Terraform

**Feature**: 002-cicd-aws-terraform  
**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical decisions for CI/CD pipeline and AWS infrastructure implementation

## Research Findings

### CI/CD Pipeline Technology Stack

**Decision**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation  
**Rationale**: 
- Already integrated with the repository structure
- Native support for Terraform and AWS CLI
- Built-in secret management capabilities
- Free tier suitable for the project scale
- Strong community support and documentation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS CodePipeline: More complex setup, additional AWS costs
- Jenkins: Requires infrastructure management overhead
- GitLab CI: Would require migration from GitHub

### AWS Infrastructure Components

**Decision**: AWS Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL, S3, CloudFront  
**Rationale**:
- Fargate: Serverless container hosting eliminates infrastructure management
- RDS PostgreSQL: Managed database with automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- S3 + CloudFront: Cost-effective static hosting with global CDN
- All components integrate well with Terraform

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ECS EC2: Requires server management and auto-scaling configuration
- Lambda: Would require significant application refactoring
- EFS: More expensive and overkill for the small file storage needs

### Infrastructure as Code Approach

**Decision**: Terraform for AWS resource provisioning  
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for AWS infrastructure as code
- Strong state management and dependency resolution
- Excellent AWS provider with comprehensive resource support
- Declarative approach reduces configuration drift

**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS CloudFormation: More AWS-specific, less flexible
- AWS CDK: Adds development overhead and learning curve
- Pulumi: Smaller community and AWS support compared to Terraform

### Secret Management Strategy

**Decision**: Encrypted environment variables in CI/CD  
**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation and maintenance
- No additional AWS service costs
- Sufficient security for the application scale
- Easier troubleshooting and debugging

**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS Secrets Manager: Additional complexity and cost
- HashiCorp Vault: Overkill for simple credential storage
- External secret management services: Additional dependencies

### Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Production-only environment with blue-green deployments  
**Rationale**:
- Reduces complexity and costs for small-scale application
- Blue-green deployments ensure zero-downtime updates
- Simpler secret management and configuration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Multi-environment setup: Additional infrastructure costs and complexity
- Rolling deployments: Higher risk of partial failures during updates

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Decision**: Automatic rollback on deployment failures  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains service availability during failed deployments
- Reduces manual intervention requirements
- Provides immediate recovery from deployment issues

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual rollback: Requires operator intervention and increases downtime
- Alert-only approach: Leaves system in potentially broken state

### Timeout and Concurrency Management

**Decision**: Immediate failure on timeout with operator alerts  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents stuck deployments from blocking new releases
- Clear failure indication for debugging
- Allows operator to investigate and resolve issues manually

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Retry with backoff: Could extend total downtime unnecessarily
- Indefinite execution: Could consume resources indefinitely

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1. Code push to main branch triggers pipeline
2. Automated testing (unit, integration, security scans)
3. Application build and containerization
4. Terraform plan and infrastructure validation
5. Blue-green deployment to AWS
6. Health checks and automatic rollback on failure

### Infrastructure Components
- **VPC**: Private and public subnets for network isolation
- **ECS Cluster**: Fargate-based cluster for backend hosting
- **RDS**: Multi-AZ PostgreSQL with automated backups
- **S3**: Static website hosting for frontend
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN with HTTPS enforcement
- **Application Load Balancer**: Traffic distribution and SSL termination

### Security Measures
- Encrypted environment variables for secrets
- IAM roles with least privilege access
- VPC security groups with minimal required ports
- HTTPS enforcement at CloudFront and ALB level
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Notes

All technical decisions align with the project constitution principles:
- **Simplicity First**: Chosen simpler options where appropriate (secrets management, single environment)
- **Security by Default**: HTTPS enforcement, least privilege IAM, proper network isolation
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for all AWS resource provisioning
- **Observability**: CloudWatch logging, health checks, automated monitoring
