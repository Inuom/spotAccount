2. **Phase 3**: Implement US1 (Subscription Management) - Core functionality
3. **Phase 4**: Implement US2 (Payment Verification) - Essential for debt settlement
4. **Phase 5-6**: Implement US3-4 (User Management, Reports) - Enhanced features

### Incremental Delivery
- **Sprint 1**: Setup + Infrastructure (T001-T025, T090-T095)
- **Sprint 2**: US1 Backend (T026-T043)
- **Sprint 3**: US1 Frontend (T044-T051)
- **Sprint 4**: US2 Backend (T052-T063)
- **Sprint 5**: US2 Frontend (T064-T071)
- **Sprint 6**: US3-4 Implementation (T072-T100)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each service and component
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Coverage Target**: 80% across all modules
