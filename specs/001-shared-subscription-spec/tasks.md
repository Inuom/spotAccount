5. **Phase 6-7**: Implement US3-4 (User Management, Reports) - Enhanced features

### Incremental Delivery
- **Sprint 1**: Setup + Infrastructure (T001-T025, T090-T095)
- **Sprint 2**: US1 Backend (T026-T044)
- **Sprint 3**: US1 Frontend (T045-T052)
- **Sprint 4**: US2 Backend (T053-T064)
- **Sprint 5**: US2 Frontend + US5 Implementation (T065-T072, T073-T084)
- **Sprint 6**: US3-4 Implementation (T085-T113)
- **Sprint 7**: PostgreSQL Migration (T114-T128)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each service and component
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Coverage Target**: 80% across all modules
