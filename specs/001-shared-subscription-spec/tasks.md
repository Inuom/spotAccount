## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order
1. **User Story 1** (P1) - Must complete first (subscription and charge foundation)
2. **User Story 2** (P1) - Can start after US1 (depends on subscription/charge data)
3. **User Story 3** (P2) - Can start after US2 (depends on payment system)
4. **User Story 4** (P3) - Can start after US3 (depends on payment data)

### Critical Dependencies
- **T011-T025**: Must complete before any user story implementation
- **T026-T043**: Must complete before T044-T058 (US2 depends on US1)
- **T044-T058**: Must complete before T059-T070 (US3 depends on US2)
- **T059-T070**: Must complete before T071-T080 (US4 depends on US3)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First Approach
1. **Phase 1-2**: Complete setup and foundational tasks
2. **Phase 3-4**: Implement P1 user stories (US1 + US2) for core functionality
3. **Phase 5-6**: Add P2-P3 user stories for enhanced functionality
4. **Phase 7**: Polish and optimization

### Incremental Delivery
- **Week 1**: Setup and foundational tasks (T001-T025)
- **Week 2**: User Story 1 implementation (T026-T043)
- **Week 3**: User Story 2 implementation (T044-T058)
- **Week 4**: User Stories 3-4 implementation (T059-T080)
- **Week 5**: Polish and testing (T081-T089)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each service and component
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows (login, subscription creation, payment verification)
- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum

## Success Criteria

### Independent Test Criteria
- **US1**: Configure subscription with 4 participants; generate charges; verify sum equals total
- **US2**: Create pending payment; mark verified; confirm balance decreases
- **US3**: User creates, updates, deletes pending payment; verified records unaffected
- **US4**: Select date; confirm totals reflect charges and verified payments

### Technical Validation
- All API endpoints return expected responses
- Database constraints enforce data integrity
- Frontend components handle all user interactions
- NgRx store maintains consistent state
- Authentication and authorization work correctly
- Error handling provides clear user feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Complete all setup tasks (T001-T010)
2. **Move to Phase 2**: Implement foundational infrastructure (T011-T025)
3. **Begin User Story 1**: Implement subscription management (T026-T043)
4. **Continue with User Story 2**: Implement payment verification (T044-T058)
5. **Add remaining user stories**: Complete US3 and US4 (T059-T080)
6. **Final polish**: Complete testing and optimization (T081-T089)

Each task is designed to be independently executable with clear acceptance criteria and file paths for implementation.
